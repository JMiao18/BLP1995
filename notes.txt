=================================================================
Notes related to the implementation of the BLP demand estimation:
=================================================================

The implementation follows the guideline create by Aviv Nevo in
his paper "A Practitioner's Guide to Estimation of Random Coefficients
Logit Models of Demand".

Variable list and description:
------------------------------
theta1 : (alpha [price coefficient], beta [characteristics coefficient])
         Linear parameters of demand

theta2 : (Pi [demographic coefficients], Gamma [additional individual characteristics coefficient])
         nonlinear parameters of demand.

PD : distribution of the demographic variables

PV : distribution of the additional individual characteristics variables

X1 : variables that enter linearly and are common to all individuals equally

X2 : variables that enter the nonlinear part and that will have random coefficients

Z  : Instrument matrix

v  : Additional individual characteristics vector.

D  : Individual demographic vector.

delta : mean valuation of products in each market


Algorithm:
----------
A rough sketch of the algorithm is as follows

0) Initialization: Sample individual characteristics and prepare data.
1) While (GMM objective function has not converged):
    1.1) Draw theta2 (from optimizer)
    1.2) Calculate theta1 by solving the first order condition of the problem.
    1.3) While (delta fixed point hasn't converged):
        1.3.1) Compute the next delta in the series by simulating the market shares
    1.4) Use found delta and theta1 to calculate the GMM objective.


TODO (future):
--------------
1) Add Bertrand marginal costs calculation
2) Add elasticity calculations
4) Optimize memory allocations
3) Improve the Jacobian algorithm
4) Improve the Anderson acceleration algorithm (transform to QR decomposition and update)
